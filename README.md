  ## Setup
  How to start the program:-
  1. Make sure you have an environment to run C++ programs.
  2. Go to your **command line** in the directory.
  3. Compile the c++ code using `g++ -o "my file name.cpp" "Adaptive Huffman encode.cpp"`.
  4. Now run `./"my file name"`.
  
  ## Working
  How the program works:-
  - It will ask you to enter the input text.
  - After the input press `Enter`.
  - You will get it's encode/decoded form.
